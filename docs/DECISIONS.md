## 1. Chapters

Five chapters drive behavior (music and the cube swipe):

| Chapter | Cards |
| --- | --- |
| Memories | 1–2 |
| Interests | 3–5 |
| Moments | 6–7 |
| People | 8–9 |
| Identity | 10–13 |

`Chapter` has five cases: `memories`, `interests`, `moments`, `people`, `identity`.

"Memories → interests → people → identity" in the PRD is the narrative arc, not the enum.

Eyebrow text is copy only. It is not a chapter id. Keep every eyebrow exactly as the HTML has it. Card 9 stays "YOUR HABITS".

## 2. Photo ids

`maya.json` ids are canonical:

`tile-1` … `tile-5`, `m-01` … `m-11`, `main-character`, `year-card`, `story-0314`, `feed-chicago`, `maya-profile`, `friend-<name>`.

On-disk renames: `tile-brunch` → `tile-1`, `tile-city` → `tile-2`, `tile-concert` → `tile-3`, `tile-hike` → `tile-4`, `tile-rooftop` → `tile-5`.

Schema payloads use these ids. A missing photo renders as the gradient placeholder tile from the designs (the same treatment as card 2's PNG). A missing image never fails the screen.

## 3. Card 13 in the player

Render the Identity card (13a) full-bleed as the card itself. Its own content already keeps the bottom 100 pt clear. In that zone, stack:

1. `SegmentedToggle` "Identity card / Numbers card" (the same component as the Hub's Personal/Creator toggle)
2. The black "Share" pill
3. A "Go to your Hub" text link

Toggling swaps to 13b with a crossfade. Player chrome (progress bars and the top row) stays on top, as on the other cards.

## 4. Chrome

The HTML wins for pixels, with these normalizations:

- The top row on every card is (i), mute, X. Replace the Pause button on cards 1, 2, and 11 with (i). Hide (i) on cards 1 and 11 (they have no metrics), leaving mute and X. Pause is hold-to-pause only, the way Instagram does it.
- Bottom pill copy varies on purpose. "Share" when the pill sits next to a provenance line (cards 3, 6, 10). "Share this story" when the pill is standalone (cards 4, 5, 7, 9). Card 8 is the private lock pill and has no share. Cards 1 and 2 have no pill. They are shareable from the Hub tile and from the later (i) / share flow.
- The HTML files may still draw a Pause button on cards 1, 2, and 11. This normalization wins over those files.

## 5. Circle order

The engine outputs the five handles sorted alphabetically: `dee.films`, `jules.mp`, `nico_k`, `sam.wav`, `tori.eats`. The PNG's order is illustrative. Positions and styling come from the PNG. Names come from the engine.

## 6. Banner copy

"About 3 min" is "About 2 min".

## 7. Card 6 copy, and every numeric sentence

The card 6 line is a template in the engine's copy layer: `"{comments} comments. Unhinged ones."` with `comments` = 418 from `maya.json`.

Any sentence that contains a number lives in a `copy` object on that card's payload. Views display those strings verbatim. Views never assemble numbers into sentences.

A big number drawn as its own figure, with a separate caption that does not contain the number, stays a structured field. That is not sentence assembly. Examples: the `47` on card 7 with the caption "replies in a day"; the `2,184` like bubble; the three reason columns on card 12 (`value` + `label`).

Finished `copy` strings for maya are in `docs/05-BACKEND-SCHEMA.md` section 5. The Hub window line and the "N cards. …" summary are engine copy on the run, because the count changes for the teen and lite tiers.

## 8. Reels 92%

Intended. These are the top 5 shares of total Reels time. The other 8% is spread across smaller categories and is not a row on the card.

Info-sheet method line: "Top 5 categories by share of your Reels watch time. Other categories: 8%."

## 9. Undrawn screens

Build undrawn screens from the design system, using the nearest designed pattern. No new visual ideas.

| Screens | Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| S02 login, S03 building, S04 before we start, S05 edition picker | Ink background, card typography, Hub buttons and segmented controls |
| S09 info sheet, S12 privacy, S11 remix | Share-sheet styling (`#121214` sheet, `ToggleChip`, `ToolRow`) |
| S13, S14, S16 | Hub row patterns |
| Web landing (S17) | The shared PNG centered on ink, one white "See yours" pill, one text link |

Designs for S02 and S09 may arrive before Step 6. If they do, they override this section.

Only the Bold remix skin (the current designs) is required until Step 20.

"Push / profile menu" is out of scope. Entry is the home banner and the Wrapped tray bubble only. `design/app-flow-map.png` still draws that box; ignore it.

`design/screens/S17-identity-card-in-story.png` is renamed `design/screens/story-posted-preview.png`. S17 means the web landing.

## 10. Instagram references

`design/reference/instagram/` has no screenshots yet. Steps 0–6 do not need them. They are added before Step 7. If they are still missing when Step 7 starts, stop and ask. Never draw the wordmark or glyph, and never invent Story motion.

## 11. Small mismatches

- The algorithm PNG shows the selected state as an example. The default state is all unselected. "More of this" becomes selected only after a tap.
- Controls drawn at 36 pt keep that visual size. The hit area expands to 44 pt with `contentShape` / padding.
- Navigation follows `docs/03-APPFLOW.md`. The `href` wiring inside `design/source/*.dc.html` is not navigation.

## 12. Step 0 environment

- Copy the kit into this repo. XcodeGen project. Local `supabase start` via Docker. Blank launch.
- Install XcodeGen, the Supabase CLI, Deno, and Node if they are missing. Hosted Supabase and the Facebook App ID wait for the steps that use them.
- There is no iPhone 16 simulator. Use the newest installed 6.1" non-Pro iPhone simulator and name it in the step report. Do not download simulator runtimes without asking.
- If Docker is not installed, stop and say so. Do not install Docker or OrbStack.
